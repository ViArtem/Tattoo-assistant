## Tattoo assistant project

This project was created to demonstrate my skill in web development

### Stacks

The application server uses `Node.js` in combination with the `Express` framework. The `grammy` library is used to connect the bot to Telegram. The database used to interact with the server is `MySQL`. The web part of the application is written in `React`. Images are generated using the `DALL-E 2 AI` API.

---

### Functionality

The bot is designed to generate images based on a description. It supports many languages and automatically translates your query into English. After generating a picture, you have the option to add it to your "favorites" so that you can quickly view it later. You can also open the image in the editor for quick editing.

### Quick start

Open the server folder in the terminal and enter the following command:

```JS
npm install
```

```JS
node application.js
```
